            The Seed to Feed Tracker is an app and dashboard that will show the
            process of seed to feed while including information about quality of
            the commodity. This will be done by allowing producers to enter
            information about the planting and growing process up until elevator
            delivery. After the grain is delivered we will be aggregating
            information from already existing players (Grand Farm, Bushel,
            AgriDigital, Geora) and displaying that information as a way to
            further market grain by showing the added value received from
            purchasing Seed to Feed product.
